## Kite Shell

*Kite Shell = Electron + Docker*

Kite Shell is a template for an Electron application that can portably execute arbitrary processes in Docker containers, hosted within a virtual machine.

It's based heavily on [Kitematic](https://kitematic.com/). Basically, I'm extracting the bits of Kitematic that deal with bootstrapping and initializing [docker-machine](https://docs.docker.com/machine/), and pruning things like "UI".
